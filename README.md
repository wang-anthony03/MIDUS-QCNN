# MIDUS-QCNN
This is a project that implements a [Quantum Convolutional Neural Network]{https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03787} to classify the digits "0" and "9" from the [MNIST-1D]{https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14439} dataset. This dataset is more difficult for classical neural networks to classify, and can serve as a better benchmark for QCNNs aginst classical learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks and deep learning.
